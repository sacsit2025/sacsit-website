# SACS-IT — Independently Verified Delivery Model
## Detailed Engagement Terms
### February 2026 — Confidential

---

## Overview

SACS-IT offers an independently verified delivery model that eliminates client risk through third-party certification and bank-backed performance guarantees. This model is adapted from standard practices in industrial engineering contracts, where our founder applied it consistently across engagements with Veolia, Degremont, and other major industrial partners.

This document describes the full mechanism. It is provided upon request as a complement to the SACS-IT Capability Profile.

## How It Works

### 1. Milestone Definition

Each project is broken into clearly defined milestones with:

- Detailed scope and deliverables per milestone
- Measurable acceptance criteria agreed by both parties
- Timeline and payment amount per milestone

### 2. Down Payment & Bank Guarantee

- The client provides a down payment for each milestone
- In counterpart, SACS-IT blocks equivalent funds at the bank as a performance guarantee
- The guarantee protects the client's advance — if SACS-IT does not deliver, the client's funds are secured

### 3. Independent Third-Party Certification

- An independent third-party consultant (e.g. APAVE, Bureau Veritas, or equivalent) is appointed to verify milestone completion
- The third party operates independently of both SACS-IT and the client
- Upon review and verification of the deliverables against the agreed acceptance criteria, the third party issues a formal certificate of completion

### 4. Payment Release

- The bank releases the blocked guarantee only upon receipt of the formal certification
- The client's milestone payment is confirmed
- Both parties proceed to the next milestone

## Third-Party Consultant Fees

The independent consultant's fees are shared equally between SACS-IT and the client:

- **Fee split:** 50% SACS-IT, 50% client
- **First payment:** Covered by the client to initiate the engagement
- **Subsequent payments:** Divided equally along the project milestones
- **Contract breach clause:** If either party breaks the contract, the breaching party assumes 100% of the remaining third-party fees

This shared cost structure ensures:

- The third party remains genuinely independent (paid by both sides)
- Both parties have financial commitment to the process
- There is a clear disincentive for contract breach

## Why This Model Exists

This model originates from our founder's 16 years of industrial engineering contracts, where every project involved:

- Major corporate clients (Veolia, Degremont, DEWA, Procter & Gamble)
- High-value deliverables with zero tolerance for failure
- Independent certification as standard practice (APAVE)

In software development, this level of delivery assurance is virtually unheard of. SACS-IT brings it as a standard option because it reflects how our founder has always worked.

## When to Use This Model

This model is recommended for:

- Large-scale platform development engagements
- Clients with strict procurement or compliance requirements
- First-time engagements where trust needs to be established
- Projects with significant financial commitment per milestone

For smaller engagements or ongoing retainer work, the standard milestone-driven delivery model may be more appropriate.

## Overview

SACS-IT is a technology studio founded in 2016 by Karim Gilbert Saikali, a systems engineer with 25 years of experience in industrial automation, enterprise software architecture, and SaaS product development.

We design, build, and operate enterprise-grade platforms from concept to production. Our current development capabilities are the direct result of 7 years of proprietary platform R&D spanning industrial automation, enterprise application frameworks, and AI infrastructure. This engineering heritage — building the engines and frameworks that power applications — is what enables us to deliver complete, production-grade platforms at an accelerated pace.

We can offer independently verified delivery — every milestone certified by a third-party consultant before payment release — ensuring clients pay exclusively for delivered results.

In the past 12 months, we have delivered multiple production platforms in parallel across hospitality, marketplace, event management, and AI infrastructure domains. All capabilities described in this document have been demonstrated in production environments.

## Technical Leadership

**Karim Gilbert Saikali** — Engineer · Architect · Operator

**Industrial Engineering (2001–2017)**

16 years delivering mission-critical systems across 6 countries in the MENA region. Every project required zero-tolerance-for-failure engineering:

- **Oil & Gas** — SCADA, process control, and safety systems: gas metering validation across 12+ streams for DEWA (Dubai), full automation fail-safe package with SIL 2 ESD and DCS integration for Banias Refinery (Syria), flow computer commissioning for Dijla Petroleum, turbine HMI replacement at Al Furat Petroleum (Syria)
- **Water & Infrastructure** — PLC programming and SCADA for major treatment plants: Jbeil and Batroun WWTPs for Degremont–Suez (Lebanon), Baalbeck, Ymmouni, and Hadjout WWTPs for Subal (Lebanon, Algeria), WPE WWTP (Algeria), Tyr WWT and Chabrouh Dam for OTV–Veolia (Lebanon)
- **FMCG & Manufacturing** — Production systems across multiple FMCG and manufacturing operations, including centralized SCADA for Aujan Industries (Barbican/Rani lines, Dubai), PLC algorithms to Procter & Gamble quality standards, and other manufacturers in Lebanon for batch control systems and real-time production tracking
- **HVAC & Building Automation** — Centralized control of 12,000 fan coil units and 150 air handling units across 24 high-rise buildings at JBR Dubai (25 towers, 2M sqm), with real-time BACnet interoperability and intelligent adaptive algorithms for energy optimization. Commissioned with APAVE.
- **Energy & Load Management** — Load-sharing and energy optimization systems for Four Seasons and Movenpick hotels

This discipline — build systems that do not fail — drives every platform we deliver.

## Proprietary Technology Foundation (2017–2024)

In 2017, we shifted from project based to R&D product development. Over 7 years, we designed and built two enterprise-grade technology platforms from the ground up — the kind of systems typically built by large corporations with dedicated engineering divisions.

### SOP Platform — Unified Industry 4.0 Operating System

A complete industrial platform replacing the need for separate SCADA, MES, CMMS, and ERP systems. Six years of R&D. Several  real-world pilot deployments.

- Proprietary real-time database engine with industrial-grade data integrity
- Native PLC communication drivers and IoT infrastructure
- Complete operational modules: alarming, archiving, recipes, scripting, event management
- Business-layer engines: Energy & Load Management, Asset Management, MES, BI & Analytics
- Supply Chain orchestration, Equipment Performance monitoring, Predictive Maintenance
- No-code dashboard builder with proprietary symbol library
- AI-ready central API gateway

### Petal.io — Enterprise Development Framework

A proprietary framework built to address the core challenge of enterprise application development: eliminating repetitive infrastructure work so teams focus on business logic.

- Domain-driven database architecture with automated schema management and smart indexing
- Microservices architecture with asynchronous message orchestration
- Real-time data synchronization with offline-first capability
- Cross-platform deployment from a single codebase
- Built-in security layer: role-based access control, row-level data isolation, encrypted storage, and audit trails
- Automated failover with redundancy by default

The architectural depth from building these two platforms — a real-time industrial operating system and a full-stack application framework — is what powers our current development capabilities. The domain-driven approach, the security-by-default patterns, and the systems-level thinking have evolved alongside modern cloud-native infrastructure, but the core principles remain unchanged.
